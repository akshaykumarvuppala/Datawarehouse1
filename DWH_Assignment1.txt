1. Design a Data Warehouse for IPL Cricket Tournament


 Here's an overview of the data warehouse design for IPL Cricket Tournament:

 Data Sources: IPL cricket tournament data can be collected from various sources like  scorecards, match reports, social media, etc. All these sources can be integrated into a data  integration platform, which can transform the data into a unified format.

 Data Storage: The data can be stored in a centralised data storage platform like a data lake  or a data warehouse. Since data warehouse is specifically designed for analytics and  reporting purposes, we will go ahead with the data warehouse approach.

 Data Model: A star schema can be used to model the data warehouse. A star schema consists of  a fact table that holds the measures and dimensions tables that provide context to the  measures. For the IPL cricket tournament, the fact table can be "Match Results" that holds  the measures like runs, wickets, overs, etc. The dimensions tables can be "Match", "Team",  "Player", "Venue", etc.

 ETL Process: Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process can be used to extract data from the  sources, transform it into a unified format and load it into the data warehouse. The ETL  process can be automated using tools like Apache Airflow, which can schedule and monitor the  ETL workflows.

 Reporting and Analytics: Once the data is loaded into the data warehouse, various reporting  and analytics tools can be used to generate insights and reports. Tools like Tableau,  PowerBI, and QlikView can be used to create visualizations and dashboards that can help the  IPL management team to make informed decisions.

 Maintenance and Optimization: Regular maintenance and optimization of the data warehouse can  ensure that the system is performing optimally. Techniques like indexing, partitioning, and  caching can be used to improve the query performance. Regular backups and disaster recovery  plans can also be put in place to ensure data safety and availability.

 This is a high-level overview of the data warehouse design for IPL cricket tournament. Based  on the specific requirements and data sources, the design can be further refined and  customized.


 The following tables can be used to model the data warehouse:

 FROM match_results f
 JOIN match_dim t ON f.team_id = t.team_id
 JOIN match_dim m ON f.match_id = m.match_id
 WHERE m.match_id = '1234';

 2.2. Query to get the number of matches played by a team in a season:

 SELECT t.team_name, m.season, COUNT(*) AS num_matches
 FROM match_dim m
 JOIN match_results f ON m.match_id = f.match_id
 JOIN team_dim t ON f.team_id = t.team_id
 WHERE t.team_name = 'Mumbai Indians' AND m.season = '2021'
 GROUP BY t.team_name, m.season;

 2.3. Query to get the top 5 players with the highest batting average:

 SELECT p.player_name, AVG(f.runs) AS batting_average
